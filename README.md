## 📖 About the Project
**Screenmatch** is a project developed during my Java course at **Alura**.  
The purpose of this project is to introduce myself to the Java language and explore more complex applications.

---

## 🎯 Goals
- Build a **full-stack application**  
- Use **Angular** for the front-end  
- Implement **Java** for the back-end  
- Manage data with **MySQL**  

This project is part of my educational journey, and I hope anyone who comes across it can learn something new or enjoy the time I invested here.
